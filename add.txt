Hello.

In December 2020 I am finishing a course at Hillel IT School on learning JavaScript. This vacancy interested me in the opportunity to start implementing the acquired knowledge and to improve my professional level and skills. If you are interested in my Ð¡V, let me know.

Have a nice day.

Sincerely,
Ivan Gimish.
